# README: VSCode Configuration for ESP-IDF Development (Xtensa & RISC-V)

This README describes how to configure Visual Studio Code for ESP-IDF development on both Xtensa and RISC-V architectures. The configuration files and instructions below are intended to be committed to your repository.

## 1. Xtensa Development

- Use a custom ESP-IDF clangd binary (`esp-clang`) instead of the system clangd, as the standard version does not fully support the Xtensa toolchain.
- The `xtensa_settings.json` file (**rename to `settings.json` and place in your project's `.vscode` directory**) should specify the path to the ESP-IDF clangd, set up the correct toolchain driver, and enable code formatting.
- The configuration is more complex due to toolchain requirements.

## 2. RISC-V Development

- Use the standard system clangd binary, which works out-of-the-box for RISC-V projects.
- The `riscv_settings.json` file (**rename to `settings.json` and place in your project's `.vscode` directory**) should specify the path to the system clangd, set up the build directory, and enable code formatting.
- The configuration is simpler than for Xtensa; no custom toolchain flags or binaries are required.


## 3. Install following VS code extensions:

- ESP-IDF
- clangd (LLVM)
- Clang-Format (Xaver Heulluer)

## 4. Drop those files in the Repo root direcotry

- .clang-format 
- .clangd


## Notes

- The `compile_commands.json` file must be generated by CMake/ESP-IDF and include the correct toolchain header paths.
- For Xtensa, using ESP-IDF's clangd is required for proper code intelligence.
- For RISC-V, the standard clangd is sufficient.
- Automatic code formatting and code intelligence are enabled via the recommended VSCode extensions.
- **Required extensions:**  
  - **Clang-Format** (`xaver.clang-format`)  
  - **LLVM/Clangd** (official extension for code intelligence)

This setup enables efficient ESP-IDF development in VSCode for both Xtensa and RISC-V architectures.
