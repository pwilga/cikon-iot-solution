        Maximum number of DS18B20 sensors to scan and register.
        Limited to 8 for memory efficiency.

    help
        Names for temperature sensors in ROM scan order (sorted by ROM ID).
        Sensors are sorted by ROM ID for deterministic ordering.
        First name = lowest ROM ID, second name = second lowest, etc.
        If fewer names than sensors, remaining get auto-names (temp0, temp1...).
